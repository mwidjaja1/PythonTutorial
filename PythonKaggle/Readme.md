## Python Tutorial: Kaggle + Widjaja
So Kaggle has a pretty good Python Tutorial online at https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python. Those PDFs are saved off to the 'KaggleLessons' directory here.

So why does this repo exist? 2 reasons.

1. Their lessons are heavily designed to let you do interactive exercises on their server and run your code there. I partially disagree with this. I think something very important about any Python Tutorial is you running on your machine, which implies, you get everything running on your machine.
2. I disagree with how some of the tutorials are ordered. And I'm sure I'll disagree with some of the exercises too.

This entire directory is a companion to the Kaggle Classes. I recommend reading the PDFs (or Website Tutorial) for each lesson. Once you're done with each lesson, pop open the Jupyter Notebook (the .ipynb files) to look at the Exercise on your computer and play along from home.

## How do I install Python?
**If you don't have Anaconda:**
1. Go to https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual and scroll down to the Anaconda Installers section.
2. Download the Python 3.x 64-bit graphical installer for your operating system... fill in 'x' with the highest number available.
3. Run the installer.

**If you do have Anaconda:**
1. Launch your Anaconda Terminal. This is 'Anaconda Prompt' on Windows from the Start Menu. On macOS, launch your Terminal app.
2. In that prompt, run `conda upgrade all` to ensure everything is updated.

## How do I open these Notebooks?
First, download all of these files to your computer. You should be able to clone this Git Repo (if you know what that means) OR download everything as a zip file, by clicking on the green button that says 'Code' above.

**After you installed Anaconda and downloaded these files**:
1. Launch your Anaconda Terminal. This is 'Anaconda Prompt' on Windows from the Start Menu. On macOS, launch your Terminal app.
2. In that prompt, run `jupyter-lab`
3. Navigate using the file browser to the ipynb extension files. Double click on one to run it.
